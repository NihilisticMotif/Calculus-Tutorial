I create lecture note about calculus and algebra by using Google Colab and LaTex. 

I do this because I enjoy learning mathematics and I realize that this project help me understand Machine Learning better.

This project contain 2 Folders
1. Theorem   (This folder contains lecture about definition, formula and proof that are relevant to various mathematical operation e.g. trigonometry function, derivartive etc.)
2. Exercise  (This folder contains lecture about exercising problem and application of the related mathematical field.)

Some lecture file in this repository are not finished and might be undated in the future.

I learn this subject mainly from freeCodeCamp.org calculus (https://youtu.be/HfACrKJ_Y2w) 
and other website (such as Khan Academy etc., some material are referenced in the lecture)

Thank you for reading my lecture.
